Git vs Gitub

Github => an internet solution to store code for developers

Login form => username and password => functionality => version1
version 2 => cncentrated on ui => issue with functionality => 2000 lines of code => not able to figure out the issue
diff version 1 and version 2 => compare changes only => easy to debug
go back to version 1


features of Git =>
1. Vwersion Control => keeps track of changes to codebase, collaborate with other devs
2. Distributed => Distributed version control => copy of codebase with its own history for all devs
3. Branching and Merging => 
Parent codebase => main/master branch => Logo with some banners => error free or bugfree
4. Commiting => Creating new versions with every commit
5. Remote repositories=>
6. Merge Conflicts => 

intro.js => Arnab =>
Shivam => some changes =>
var x = '123

x => in different way

var x = function(){}
to call something => create some objects

Sohban => copy1 => Login Page => own branch => 1. prevents error in parent codebase, 2. Develop work individually without merge to parent codebase
Pritam => copy2 => Prodcuts page => own branch
Kuldeep => copy3 => Payment page => own branch 


Repository => Folder => Project Folder

git clone => https://github.com/thesiddharthkhare/FT-37

Clone => downloading/making a copy of repository on Github onto vs code

Stage and Commit => add, commit
git add <filename> or git add .=> Staging => collects all files which have to be apart of the new system

git commit -m "Meaningful commit message => commit => creating the new version

Push => git push origin <branchname> => upload to github
